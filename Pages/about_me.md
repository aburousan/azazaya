# About me
Hi!!... I am **Kazi Abu Rousan**, a student of [Indian Association for The Cultivation of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Association_for_the_Cultivation_of_Science), doing my master's degree in Physics with specilization in Cosmology. I also teaches Maths and Physics for olympiad in [Cheenta Ganit Kendra](https://www.cheenta.com/).

# Some of my Works
Some of the things written by me,
* [Time Crystal as a consequence of NonCommutative Quantum Mechanics for 2D Harmonic Oscillator](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372221313_Time_Crystal_as_a_consequence_of_NonCommutative_Quantum_Mechanics_for_2D_Harmonic_Oscillator) ![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazi-Abu-Rousan/publication/372221313/figure/fig1/AS:11431281173427597@1688888680920/Physical-Realisation-of-Time-Crystal_W640.jpg)
This was done in the 2023 summer research project under the guidence of Prof. Archan S Majumdar under S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences.
* [Basic Recombination and Formation of Neutral Hydrogen in Early Universe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376889659_Basic_Recombination_and_Formation_of_Neutral_Hydrogen_in_Early_Universe) ![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazi-Abu-Rousan/publication/376889659/figure/fig7/AS:11431281214834585@1703796954888/Comparison-of-Saha-Boltzmann-and-Peeble-Equation-Here-Boltzmann-Equation-means-the_W640.jpg)
In this article I have discussed the mechanism of **Recombination in the early universe** and have discribed **Peeble's Equation**.
* [Extension of Gauss circle problem: Lattices for a Triangular grid and discovery of a new formula of $\pi$](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370161335_Extension_of_Gauss_circle_problem_Lattices_for_a_Triangular_grid)
![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazi-Abu-Rousan/publication/370161335/figure/fig3/AS:11431281152663383@1682100177142/A-circle-of-Radius-7-has-18-lattice-points-on-it_Q320.jpg)
Here I have tried to extend the **Gauss's Circle Problem** for a triangular grid and also found a new infinite series for $\pi$.
* [Diffraction patterns by different orientation of rectangular Apertures: Intuitive understanding of Optical Transformations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356142815_Diffraction_patterns_by_different_orientation_of_rectangular_Apertures_Intuitive_understanding_of_Optical_Transformations)
![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazi-Abu-Rousan/publication/356142815/figure/fig2/AS:1098551824265217@1638926573534/Diffraction-pattern-of-the-aperture-in-Fig-2.ppm)
This article is based on a problem which came in tifr exam. Here, I have discussed how diffraction patterns can change depending upon different configuration of apertures and simulated the things using python.
* [Method of Images and It's Relation to Optical Images](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-022-1398-y)![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazi-Abu-Rousan/publication/361545877/figure/fig7/AS:1171982066429952@1656433707070/Here-you-see-the-fields-from-qred-to-qblue-The-field-is-symmetry-about-the-grounded_W640.jpg)
Here I have tried to show how **Optical Lense** formulas are similar to that of **electrostatic method of images**.
* [Introduction to Anyons and Generalized Distribution Function](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352641643_Introduction_to_Anyons_and_generalized_distribution_function)
![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazi-Abu-Rousan/publication/352641643/figure/fig3/AS:1040709511565313@1625135891075/The-reflection-operation-with-respect-to-one-axis-This-shows-ph-p-and-ph-p-are.ppm)
This is my BSc. project, here I have tried to find a **generalized distribution function** which **anyons** follow. We can get **Bosonic** and **Fermionic** distribution function from that function as a special case.

* I also loves to make animation using **manim**-- a python library build by Grant (3blue1brown) to make animation videos on different topics of maths and physics. Here is the [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTDTcDkWcXuzwI6M1bGzNh6dDPCB9qZiu&si=I8vaX6GaIaK5jVei).

# Some extra Mentorship

* I have been a mentor for a Summer School of Astrophysics in 2023. For more visit their website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/intro-2-astro/2023-course). To access notes and assignment visit [here](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro2023/tree/main/Week2_packages_plotting) (The ones on matplotlib and numpy, Scipy and Astropy are made by me).
